# geojson_citydata
Different GeoJSON files to integrate in web / mobile applications.
This repository is for a study project and nothing special. But feel free to do whatever you want :D


Just for explanation:
I use this geojson data in a project to visualize city data for Berlin (buildings, poi's, infrastructure and transportation).
